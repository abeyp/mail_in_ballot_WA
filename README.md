# Universal Vote-by-Mail in Washington | Statistics 
[Current Project] Mail-In Ballot Trends in Washington, USA.

**A Personal Note**

The Ballot Drop Box stands to be a visual reminder of my community's voting power in every election, locally and nationally. 

When I moved to Seattle, WA, I became most active voter in my life. Upon registering for a WA Driver's License, I became 1 of 4.8 million Washingtonians to be automatically registered as an eligible voter under Universal Vote-by-Mail (UVM).

Every election, I receive a ballot and voter pamphlet. On election day, I proceed to procrastinate for hours swarming the internet to discover and develop my hypoerlocal, political values. I developed an appreciation for the ballot Drop Box down the street next to the neighborhood public library. 

**Goals**
- Explore publically available datasets provided by Secretary of State Elections Divison Office for future projects. 


**Questions for the project:** 
- What do overall voting trends look like Statewide?
- What is Universal Vote-By-Mail, and how many people use Drop Boxes?

## Drop Box Usage in General Elections
In a relatively high voter turnout state compared to other US states, how does Washington behave towards Drop Box Usage?


UVM passed in Washington in 2011. Formal standardized data collection from counties began in 2012.
